        During the pandemic, I embarked on a transformative journey into
        computer science, beginning with foundational skills in Python and Java
        and quickly advancing to C++. Driven by curiosity and a dedication to
        innovate within the digital space, I expanded my expertise to full-stack
        development, mastering the MERN stack along with React and Next.js. This
        progression has empowered me to create dynamic applications, with a
        focus on usability and cutting-edge functionality. As my career evolved,
        I applied my technical skills within the automotive industry, managing
        complex engineering projects and leading cross-functional teams for
        premium German OEMs. My role required a meticulous understanding of
        automotive components, from E-Locks to Bowden cables, where I handled
        everything from risk assessment and system tolerance definition to
        production line overviews. This experience honed my ability to balance
        precision with strategic project management, resulting in seamless and
        efficient implementations. Now, Iâ€™m channeling this blend of technical
        and project management expertise into the fintech and SaaS domains,
        exploring innovative applications that address key market pain points.
        My recent projects include a Deezer-integrated music app, an AI-powered
        bug tracking tool, and an upcoming portfolio website built with Next.js,
        TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I am also building SaaS products tailored
        for the EU market, navigating compliance intricacies to ensure
        regulatory alignment. My goal is to build a SaaS startup with products
        that are not only efficient but transformative, adding true value by
        solving complex, real-world problems for users.
